My name is Ali Abbasi. I'm a first-year computer science Ph.D. student at <a href="https://www.vanderbilt.edu/">Vanderbilt University</a>, doing research in <a href="https://mint-vu.github.io/">Machine Intelligence and Neural Technologies (MINT) Lab</a> under the supervision of <a href="https://skolouri.github.io/">Dr. Soheil Kolouri</a>. Prior to joining Vanderbilt, I obtained my B.Sc. in electrical engineering from the <a href="https://ut.ac.ir/en">University of Tehran</a> in 2020. 

My research interest lies in the interection of computer vision and reinforcement learning. I'm curious to know how machines can efficiently see, learn, and interact with their environment through simulating a human-like learning experience for them. 

My hobbies are running, lifting weights, and hiking but I'd cancel all of them if someone invites me to play poker.
